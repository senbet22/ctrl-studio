## Getting Started

To install dependencies:

```bash
npm install

```

To run the project:

```bash
npm run dev

```

## Carousel

For my carousel i have chosen to use Embla Carousel: (https://www.embla-carousel.com/)
I chose Embla Carousel because it's lightweight, fast, and easy to integrate.


## Things to add later:

- CMS for The developers to Update info. (Check out sanity.io for a headless CMS solution.)
- Norwegian and S√°mi version of the website.
- Policy Pricacy / Terms and conditions pages. (If i want the page to remain SPA then maybe a Modal window?)
- Animated H1 The game title, should blink or expand and shrink as you enter the site.
- More sophisticated Newsletter with checkmarks for different things.
- Favourite game of each team member at the bottom of the TeamData Cards.
