## Getting Started

To install dependencies:

```bash
npm install

```

To run the project:

```bash
npm run dev

```

## Carousel

For my carousel i have chosen to use Embla Carousel: (https://www.embla-carousel.com/)
I chose Embla because i need something more simple and lightweight.

## Things to add later:

- CMS for The developers to Update info.
- Animated H1 The game title, should bling or expand and shrink as you enter the site.
- Favourite game of each team member at the bottom of the TeamData Cards.
- More sophisticated Newsletter with checkmarks for different things.
- Policy Pricacy / Terms and conditions pages. (If i want the page to remain SPA then maybe a Modal window? )
- Norwegian and S√°mi version of the website
