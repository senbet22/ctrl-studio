Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Carousel

For my carousel i have chosen to use Embla Carousel: (https://www.embla-carousel.com/)
I chose Embla because i need something more simple and lightweight.

## Things to add later:

- CMS for The developers to Update info.
- Responsive Animated in-game Characters on About and Lore section.
- Favourite game of each team member at the bottom of the TeamData Cards.
- More sophisticated Newsletter with checkmarks for different things.
- Policy Pricacy / Terms and conditions pages. (If i want the page to remain SPA then maybe a Modal window? )
- Norwegian and SÃ¡mi version of the website
