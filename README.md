## Features

### Language Support

- **Bilingual Interface**: Full support for English and Norwegian (Norsk Bomkål).
- **Persistent Language Preference**: The browser remembers your language choice across sessions using Cookies

### Carousel

For the carousel in the Lore section, we use Embla Carousel: (https://www.embla-carousel.com/)
Embla Carousel was chosen because it's lightweight, fast, and easy to integrate.

## Things to add later:

- **CMS Integration**: Future implementation of Sanity.io or similar CMS when the team needs to update content independently.
- **Sámi Language Support**: Expand from current English and Norwegian to include Sámi as a third language option.
- **Mailing List Integration**: Research and implement a cost-effective email service provider for newsletter subscriptions and community updates.
- **Privacy Policy / Terms and Conditions pages**
