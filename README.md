## Carousel

For my carousel in Lore section i have chosen to use Embla Carousel: (https://www.embla-carousel.com/)
I chose Embla Carousel because it's lightweight, fast, and easy to integrate.

## Things to add later:

- CMS for The developers to Update info. Currently looking into Sanity.io and will implement this so the dev's can update the sections themselves.
- Norwegian and S√°mi version of the website: also let the devs update data with different langueges using sanity.io.
- Research and identify the most cost-effective and scalable third-party application for Support/Subscribe section.
- Policy Pricacy / Terms and conditions pages. (If i want the page to remain SPA then maybe a Modal window?)
- Favourite game of each team member at the bottom of the TeamData Cards.
